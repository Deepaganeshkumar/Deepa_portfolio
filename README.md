#Project 1 :
This is a project I did for my Master’s research paper
•	This repository represents "Deep learning based approaches for detecting covid"
•	With the help of this project we can detect whether the person is affected by covid or not
Description 	
•	In this project I have used Convolution Neural Network for detecting covid
•	The model uses Deep learning Techniques
