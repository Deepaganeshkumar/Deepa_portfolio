# Project 1 :Deep learning based approaches for detecting covid
This is a project I did for my Masterâ€™s research paper
* This repository represents "Deep learning based approaches for detecting covid"
*	With the help of this project we can detect whether the person is affected by covid or not
* In this project I have used Convolution Neural Network for detecting covid
* The model uses Deep learning Techniques
